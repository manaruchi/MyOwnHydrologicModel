# My-Own-Hydrologic-Model
This highly ambitious repo aims at developing a hydrological model (similar to VIC) in Python. The main considerations are user frinedliness, modular programming and learning about different hydrological processes.

This idea came to my mind when i was trying to run VIC model for my Master thesis. How all the processes worked, why choose a particular method for calculation of a particular variable, why do we need this much of data, what can be done to make it more user-friendly. Therefore, i started reading Applied Hydrology by Ven Te Chow. I found out a lot of information which was hard for me to grasp or understand even. So i planned to learn more and more about these processes along with implementing it in Python. In such ways, this idea was born.

The model would be conceptually based on VIC, but it would be built from scratch. I will post the progress here in this repo along with proper documentation (i might learn to write proper and good documentation along the process). This project is only for my learning purpose and i neither have plans on making a "software" nor earning money from it. 

The outlines of this project are:

1. Learn about different hydrologic processes and how they are quantified and develop functions side by side.
2. Make the functions modular, user-friendly with **proper documentation**.
3. Try to incorporate AI/ML/DL.
4. Finally, make a GUI.
